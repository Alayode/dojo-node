Dojo: The Definitve Guide

In Dojo, the convention of prefixing internal members that should be treated as private with a leading underscore
is common and will be used throughout this book. It's important to really respect such conventions because "private"
members may be quite volatile.

This example will illustrate the reusability and portability of the dtdg.Genie module.
You simply require it into the page end and, once it's initialized, it "just works."

A finer point worth clarifying is the use of djConfig to configure Dojo before bootstrapping:
the modulePaths is inlined to qualify the location fo the modulerelative to baseUrl, which
is definedas the current working directory. Thus, from a physical standpoint, the file
structure might look like
